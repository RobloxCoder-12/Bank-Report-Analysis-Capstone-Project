Banks struggle to monitor loan portfolio health and repayment trends due to scattered data sources and lack of unified reporting. To address this, I developed an interactive Bank Loan Report in Power BI, integrating KPIs such as total loan applications, funded amount, repayments, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. The project included dashboards for loan quality (good vs. bad loans), regional analysis, loan purpose breakdown, and borrower demographics—enabling data-driven insights and better lending decisions


Key Highlights 

Data Engineering: Imported raw loan datasets into MS SQL Server, performed data cleaning, transformation, and created queries for KPIs (MTD, MoM trends).

Interactive Dashboards: Built three dashboards (Summary, Overview, Details) in Power BI & Tableau showing loan quality, regional distribution, purpose breakdown, and borrower demographics.

KPI Monitoring: Automated tracking of Good vs. Bad Loans, Total Funded Amount, Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, DTI.

Business Impact: Improved visibility into loan health and repayment trends, enabling faster risk assessment and better financial planning
